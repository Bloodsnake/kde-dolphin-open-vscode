## Install

Can be installed from the dolphin service menu, store, or manually.

Note that the store version is out of date because their site is broken and not allowing login. Prefer the GitHub version for the most recent version until they fix that.

- [Store](https://store.kde.org/p/1413799/)
- Manual: copy the .desktop file to `~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/`
